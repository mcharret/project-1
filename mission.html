    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p><strong>Founded in 2005</strong>, Clean Earth started as a grassroots movement driven by a group of concerned citizens who were passionate about protecting the environment. Over the years, we have grown into an international NGO with a powerful voice in the global environmental movement.</p>
    
    <p>Some of our key milestones include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>2007</strong>: Launching our first major campaign to reduce single-use plastic in coastal areas.</li>
        <li><strong>2010</strong>: Partnering with international organizations to promote sustainable energy projects in developing countries.</li>
        <li><strong>2015</strong>: Playing a key role in advocating for stricter climate targets during the Paris Agreement negotiations.</li>
        <li><strong>2018</strong>: Initiating the "Clean Oceans" campaign focused on marine conservation and reducing ocean plastic waste.</li>
        <li><strong>2023</strong>: Launching the "Green Cities" project to promote green infrastructure and sustainable urban development in cities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Today, Clean Earth continues to lead the charge in the fight against climate change and environmental degradation. Our commitment to direct action and collaboration with communities and governments has made us a leading force for environmental justice worldwide.</p>
